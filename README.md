# WorldUpdater
The purpose of this simple plugin is to help you keep your world up to date when switching from one version to another, how? This plugin will simply remove all chunks that do not touch WorldGuard regions, so you will need to make a region for each of your players' bases, and run the "convertmyworld" command

Attention! Please make a backup of your world before using this command, I will not be responsible for any damage caused on your map if you do not do this!
